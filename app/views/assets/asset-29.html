    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Accessibility statement for Check for flooding</h1>
    <p>This accessibility statement applies to content published on the check-for-flooding.service.gov.uk domain.</p>
    <p>This website is run by the Environment Agency. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
      <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
      <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
      <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Reporting accessibility problems with this website</h2>
    <p>We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, email: enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Enforcement procedure</h2>
    <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS).</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Contacting us by phone</h2>
    <p>We provide a text relay service for people who are D/deaf, hearing impaired or have a speech impediment.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
    <p>The Environment Agency is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Compliance status</h3>
    <p>This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>
    <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
    <p>Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>
    <p>We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2020. When we publish new content we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards.</p>
    <p>Buttons on some pages do not have a correct label or role identified, which affects how they work with assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criteria 2.4.4 (link purpose) and 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>
    <p>Some pages automatically refresh and people cannot stop or control the frequency of the refresh. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.2.2 (pause, stop, control).</p>
    <p>Content on some pages is not in a logical nested order. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 (headings and labels).</p>
    <p>It’s not always clear where the focus is on some pages while navigating using a keyboard. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criteria 2.1.1 (keyboard), 2.1.2 (no keyboard trap), 2.4.3 (focus order), and 2.4.7 (focus visible).</p>
    <p>Some pages have a map that is not labeled correctly, which affects how it works with assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criteria 2.1.2 (no keyboard trap) and 4.1.2 (name, role, value).</p>
    <p>Some pages have content inside a text reveal component that does not work with assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 (headings and labels).</p>
    <p>Some pages have graphs with no alternative text, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>
    <p>When viewed on a mobile, some images are not in a logical order. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (information and relationships).</p>
    <p>On one page, some adjacent links go to the same URL. This results in additional navigation and repetition for users using a keyboard or assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.4 (link purpose).</p>
    <p>Some river level pages include a forecast of the level, and the forecast data is in the downloadable 'height data CSV'. But once downloaded, the forecast data is soon out of date as the forecast is updated every 15 minutes. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>
    <p>We plan to have an alternative way to present the river level forecast in an accessible format by December 2021.</p>
    <p>Charts visually convey if a river level is rising, falling or stable. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>
    <p>We plan to have a text version of this real time data by December 2021.</p>
    <p>The close button on the chart label is not operable using the keyboard and neither is selecting an inactive threshold line. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1 (keyboard accessible).</p>
    <p>We plan to add close button to tabindex by December 2021.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Disproportionate burden</h3>
    <p>[Note: in this subsection list accessibility problems you’re claiming would be a disproportionate burden to fix.</p>
    <p>Bear in mind that something which is a disproportionate burden now will not necessarily be a disproportionate burden forever. If the circumstances change, your ability to claim disproportionate burden may change too.]</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Navigation and accessing information</h3>
    <p>There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option).</p>
    <p>It’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content.</p>
    <p>It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping.</p>
    <p>We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information. We believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in [rough timing].</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
    <p>The website has the following content which is out of scope of the accessibility regulations:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>maps</li>
      <li>third party content which is out of our control, for example a corporate logo on the map the website uses</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
    <p>[Note: publishing an accessibility roadmap is optional. It’s a good idea to publish one if you want to be specific about the order you’re planning to tackle accessibility issues, and there’s no space to do so in the accessibility statement itself.]</p>
    <p>Our accessibility roadmap [add link to roadmap] shows how and when we plan to improve accessibility on this website.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
    <p>This statement was prepared on [date when it was first published]. It was last reviewed on [date when it was last reviewed].</p>
    <p>This website was last tested on [date]. The test was carried out by DAC.</p>
    <p>We used this approach to deciding on a sample of pages to test [add link to explanation of how you decided which pages to test].</p>
